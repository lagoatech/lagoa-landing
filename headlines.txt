Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive

Analytics––descriptive, predictive and prescriptive is a rapidly evolving field that gives companies the knowledge to make smarter business decisions. 
It provides valuable insight into past performance and future prediction and decision guidance.
 According to Gartner, the number of companies using prescriptive analytics tools may increase from ~10% in 2016 to over 35% by the end of 2020.
Gurobi Optimizer is one of these tools: a math programming solver. While prescriptive analytics is growing, analytics overall is still dominated by descriptive (what happened in the past) and predictive (what is likely to happen in the future) tools.
 As a result, it’s important to see how prescriptive analytics fits into the broader analytics landscape.
